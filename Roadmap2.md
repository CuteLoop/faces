### **Revised Project Roadmap**

#### **1. Dataset Preparation**
- **Objective**: Prepare the Yale B and LFW datasets for SVD-based analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Load images using MATLAB’s `imageDatastore` for easy file management.
  - Preprocess images:
    - Convert to grayscale.
    - Resize to `128x128`.
    - Normalize pixel values to `[0, 1]`.
  - Store processed images in a matrix \( A \), where each column is a vectorized image.
- **Testing**:
  - Validate that the preprocessing steps produce correctly formatted and normalized images.
  - Visualize a sample of the preprocessed images for sanity checks.

---

#### **2. Singular Value Decomposition**
- **Objective**: Perform SVD on the image matrix and extract eigenfaces.
- **Steps**:
  - Decompose \( A \) into \( U, \Sigma, V^T \) using `svd`.
  - Select top \( k \) eigenfaces (columns of \( U \)) based on singular values.
  - Visualize top eigenfaces for interpretability.
  - Cache \( U, \Sigma, V^T \) for reusability during testing.
- **Testing**:
  - Verify that \( A \approx U \Sigma V^T \) by reconstructing a subset of images and comparing with originals.
  - Evaluate reconstruction error for different values of \( k \).

---

#### **3. Feature Extraction**
- **Objective**: Extract features for classification using the top \( k \) singular vectors.
- **Steps**:
  - Retain the top \( k \) rows of \( V^T \) as feature vectors.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Testing**:
  - Check that the feature vectors accurately represent the original images by reconstructing images using \( U, \Sigma, V^T \).

---

#### **4. Classification**
- **Objective**: Train supervised classifiers to recognize faces.
- **Steps**:
  - Implement a binary classification demo (e.g., `Angelina Jolie` vs. `Eduardo Duhalde`) using `fitcsvm`.
  - Scale to multiclass classification using `fitcecoc`.
  - Train models on training data and evaluate on testing data.
  - Visualize feature space using scatter plots for top predictors.
- **Testing**:
  - Use metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curves to evaluate classifiers.
  - Experiment with different values of \( k \) and classifier settings to optimize performance.

---

#### **5. HPC Integration**
- **Objective**: Leverage MATLAB’s Parallel Computing Toolbox for scalability.
- **Steps**:
  - Parallelize the SVD computation using `parfor` or distributed arrays.
  - Distribute classification tasks across HPC nodes for multiclass models.
- **Testing**:
  - Measure execution time for SVD and classification with and without parallelization.
  - Verify correctness by comparing results from parallel and serial implementations.

---

#### **6. Evaluation and Metrics**
- **Objective**: Quantify the system’s performance.
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified faces.
  - **Compression Ratio**: Number of retained components \( k \) vs. original dataset size.
  - **Execution Time**: Time for SVD and classification (both serial and parallel).
  - **Reconstruction Error**: Measure fidelity of reconstructed images.
- **Visualization**:
  - Generate confusion matrices and ROC curves for all classifiers.
  - Plot execution time vs. dataset size or number of HPC nodes.

---

#### **7. Extensions**
- **Objective**: Explore advanced applications and scalability.
- **Ideas**:
  - Compare SVD-based dimensionality reduction with PCA.
  - Experiment with larger datasets and evaluate scalability.
  - Implement real-time recognition using MATLAB’s webcam interface and precomputed features.
