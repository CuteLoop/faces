### Developer Roadmap for **Facial Recognition Using Singular Value Decomposition in MATLAB with HPC Integration**

#### Phase 1: **Setup and Familiarization**
1. **Understand the Project Scope**  
   - Review the project objectives, methodology, and datasets.
   - Familiarize yourself with MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox and HPC environment.  
   - Study relevant SVD concepts and their application in image processing.

2. **Environment Setup**  
   - Install MATLAB and ensure access to the Parallel Computing Toolbox.  
   - Set up HPC credentials and access configurations.  
   - Clone or access tutorials/resources such as [MATLAB MPI GitHub repository](https://github.com/mrychlik/matlabmpi).  
   - Test the MATLAB-HPC connection by running a sample parallelized script.

#### Phase 2: **Dataset Preparation**
1. **Dataset Collection**  
   - Download the **Extended Yale B Dataset** and **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)**.
   - Verify the integrity of the datasets.

2. **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**  
   - Write MATLAB scripts to:
     - Convert images to grayscale.
     - Resize all images to a fixed dimension (e.g., `128 × 128`).
     - Normalize pixel values to `[0, 1]`.
   - Test preprocessing scripts on a small subset of images.  
   - Optimize preprocessing for parallel execution using MATLAB's `parfor`.

3. **Documentation**  
   - Create a clear, step-by-step guide for the dataset preparation process.

#### Phase 3: **SVD Implementation**
1. **Data Matrix Construction**  
   - Write a script to vectorize images and form the data matrix \( A \).  
   - Confirm the dimensionality of \( A \) for a small dataset.

2. **Apply Singular Value Decomposition**  
   - Implement the SVD algorithm in MATLAB: `A = U * Σ * V'`.  
   - Visualize and verify the eigenfaces (columns of \( U \)).  
   - Retain top \( k \) singular values and vectors for dimensionality reduction.  

3. **Optimize SVD for HPC**  
   - Parallelize the SVD computation using the Parallel Computing Toolbox and HPC resources.  
   - Use MATLAB's `svds` function for large datasets.  
   - Benchmark execution time with and without parallelization.

#### Phase 4: **Feature Extraction**
1. **Reduced Representation**  
   - Use the top \( k \) weights from \( V^T \) to create feature vectors for each image.  
   - Verify the dimensionality and quality of the reduced feature vectors.

2. **Save Processed Data**  
   - Save reduced feature vectors and metadata (e.g., labels) for training and testing.  
   - Implement robust saving/loading mechanisms for efficient experimentation.

#### Phase 5: **Supervised Classification**
1. **Split Data**  
   - Divide the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80-20 split).

2. **Model Selection and Implementation**  
   - Train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier using `fitcsvm`.  
   - Alternatively, implement k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) using `fitcknn`.  

3. **Validation and Testing**  
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics like **accuracy**.  
   - Compare results for different values of \( k \) (dimensionality).  
   - Visualize classification results using confusion matrices or other techniques.

#### Phase 6: **Performance Evaluation**
1. **Measure Metrics**  
   - Calculate:
     - **Accuracy**: Percentage of correctly classified faces.
     - **Compression Ratio**: Retained components to original dataset size.
     - **Execution Time**: Time for SVD and classification.

2. **Scalability Testing**  
   - Experiment with larger datasets or synthetic datasets to test HPC scalability.  
   - Use additional HPC nodes to parallelize the workload further.

#### Phase 7: **Extensions**
1. **Compare with PCA**  
   - Implement PCA for dimensionality reduction and compare performance with SVD.  

2. **Real-Time Recognition**  
   - Explore MATLAB’s webcam interface to perform live recognition using pre-computed features.  
   - Optimize for low latency and high accuracy.

3. **Write a Report**  
   - Document the implementation process, results, and key insights.  
   - Include visualizations like execution time comparisons, accuracy plots, and confusion matrices.

#### Phase 8: **Presentation and Submission**
1. **Create Presentation Slides**  
   - Summarize objectives, methodology, results, and conclusions.  
   - Include visual aids like eigenfaces, performance metrics, and scalability results.

2. **Submit Project**  
   - Package the final MATLAB scripts, processed datasets, and report.  
   - Verify reproducibility by including a README with clear instructions.
