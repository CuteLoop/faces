[![Open in MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/images/responsive/global/open-in-matlab-online.svg)](https://matlab.mathworks.com/open/github/v1?repo=CuteLoop/faces)

This repository contains the implementation of a scalable facial recognition system using **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** in **MATLAB** with **High-Performance Computing (HPC)** integration. The project demonstrates the use of parallel computation for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, and classification of facial images from publicly available datasets.

## Introduction
Facial recognition systems are vital in applications such as security, authentication, and human-computer interaction. This project leverages **SVD** for dimensionality reduction and feature extraction, combined with MATLAB's Parallel Computing Toolbox to handle large datasets efficiently.

### Key Objectives:
- Implement **SVD** for feature extraction.
- Utilize **HPC resources** for computationally intensive tasks.
- Train and test a supervised classification model for face recognition.
- Evaluate computational efficiency, accuracy, and scalability.
